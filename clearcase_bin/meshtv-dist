# This script tars up a "package" for distribution on the net.  It tars up
# files, compresses them, and wraps them in a Bourne shell script that allows

#     Since the HP's don't like the B option to tar, use b 20 instead.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Thu Aug 15 16:10:29 PDT 1996
#     /bin/sh on the HP's don't like "chdir", so change it to "cd.

#     I modified it to get the list of files from either the script
#     meshtv_files or silo_files.  The user can control which list is
#     used by specifying -meshtv or -silo on the execute line.  The
#     default is -meshtv.

#     I modified the routine to reference the package generation scripts
#     in the clearcase_bin directory.  I modified the script to also
#     save up the help files.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Wed Aug 13 14:47:18 PDT 1997
#     Completely restructured the script so that it uses the "package" script
#     directly, rather than trying to do everything on its own.  Also changed
#     how we parse command line arguments to more of a perly way.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Mon Sep  8 16:30:59 PDT 1997
#     Added running of "mkman" to get the list of files in the "help"
#     directory.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Mon Sep  8 17:01:50 PDT 1997
#     All of the scripts and such now run with an absolute path rather than
#     searching $PATH.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Tue Sep  9 16:46:28 PDT 1997
#     Changed the script to use "find" instead of "mkman" to get the list of
#     files in the "help" directory.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Tue Sep 30 14:02:28 PDT 1997
#     The list of files to be packaged up are now passed to the "package"
#     script by way of stdin, rather than explicitly listing them on the
#     command line.  Also, the script now checks to make sure you are running
#     it from the root of the directory hierarchy.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Tue Sep 30 14:17:41 PDT 1997
#     Changed the script so that it runs perl from your PATH, rather than being
#     hardcoded.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Tue Aug 11 17:06:47 PDT 1998
#     Changed how we list the files in the help directory.
#
#     Sean Ahern, Wed Aug 12 11:19:49 PDT 1998
#     Added the -nohelp option to exclude the help files.
