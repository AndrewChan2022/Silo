# Modifications:
#	Robb Matzke, 13 Nov 1996
#	Moved `aio' before `aio_drv' in the SUBDIRS list because the aio
#	driver depends on the `aio.h' header file.
#
#	Robb Matzke, 3 Feb 1997
#	Fixed a bug that caused an infinite loop in make if a subdirectory
#	didn't exist or wasn't readable.
#
#	Robb Matzke, 10 Mar 1997
#	The `clean' target removes the library.
#
#	Sean Ahern, Mon Oct 12 17:25:12 PDT 1998
#	Removed AIO and the AIO driver.
#
#       Eric Brugger, Mon Mar 15 11:35:05 PST 1999
#       Made the netcdf, pdb and taurus drivers optional.
#
#       Sean Ahern, Mon Mar 13 15:14:11 PST 2000
#       Added the tools directory.  Moved the browser there.
#
#       Jeremy Meredith, Tue Oct 10 16:52:37 PDT 2000
