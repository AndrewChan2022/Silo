#   The `clean' target removes objects from the library instead of
#   the removing the entire library.

#   Changed how we treat "sdxproto.h" and "sdx.inc".  They are no longer
#   dependences when doing a "make pubhdr".  When you need to regenerate then,
#   do a "make sdxproto.h" (or whatever file).
#

#   I removed the reference to $tmplib from the LIBS variable since it is
#   now included in the LDFLAGS variable.
#
#   Eric Brugger, Thu Sep  2 16:16:00 PDT 1999
#   I modified the sdxproto.c and sdxproto.h targets so that rpcgen would
#   be run so that prototypes are generated.  I also modified the clean
#   target to remove the sample programs and related object files.
#
#   Eric Brugger, Tue Sep 21 07:56:06 PDT 1999
#   Remove the dependencies from sdxproto.c and sdxproto.h so that they only
#   get regenerated when the user types make sdxproto.c or make sdxproto.h.

## The following `sed' command gets rid of trailing `,' since some
## compilers don't like them.  The following `grep' command gets
## rid of forward declarations for the sdxproto.c functions.

sdxproto.h:
	echo "/* This file is machine generated--do not modify */" > $@
	rpcgen -h -P sdxproto.x |\

## The following `sed' command gets rid of the `xdr_SDXarray' function.
## Sed depends on rpcgen producing "normally" indented C code.

##
## Automatic dependency stuff.
## We can't do automatic dependencies for sdxd.c since we can't (in general)
## include the `sdxd.d' file.
