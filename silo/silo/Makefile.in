#   The `clean' target removes objects from the library instead of
#   the removing the entire library.

#   Changed how we treat "silo.inc".  It is no longer a dependency when doing a
#   "make pubhdr".  When you need to regenerate it (when "silo.h", or
#   "silo_f.h" changes), do a "make silo.inc" explicitly.  I also removed the
#   character "@" from the command generating "silo.inc".

#   Removed "silo.inc" from the "clean" target.
#
#   Robb Matzke, 18 Apr 1997
#   Prevented that panic-invoking `perl was not found' from being printed
#   when make runs except when perl is actually not found.
#
#   Sean Ahern, Tue Feb 24 14:17:19 PST 1998
#   Added INSTALL_HDR so we can tailor the list of files we install.  Added 
#   manual installation of "silo.inc" so ClearMake doesn't try to recreate it.
