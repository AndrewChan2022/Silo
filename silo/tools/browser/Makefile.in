#   Got rid of the "Changes" file from DISTRIB since we don't have the file any
#   more.
#
#   Eric Brugger, Thu Aug 13 09:29:36 PDT 1998
#   I removed the reference to $tmplib from the LIBS variable since it is
#   now included in the LDFLAGS variable.
#
#   Robb Matzke, 2000-06-06
#   Removed definitions of HTML_BROWSERS and DOC_URL since the browser no
#   longer needs them for its `help' command.
