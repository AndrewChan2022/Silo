Silo Development FAQ
--------------------
1) Some file timestamps become an issue, because of the ClearCase file
   write protection on non-checkedout files, there will be errors in
   the build because of these make dependencies. Most of these files
   can be created manually, by looking at the creating scripts in the
   Makefiles. (useful command: force a timestamp update "ct ci -ident")
   make sure that the timestamps of:
   - Autoreconf files, just make sure of the ClearCase checkin order
   ./configure       > ./configure.ac
   */Makefile.in     > */Makefile.am
   - Targets in tests, used by autotest (i.e., make check)
   tests/package.m4  > ./configure.ac
   tests/testsuite   > tests/testsuite.at
   - Target in src/silo/Makefile,
   src/silo/silo.inc > src/silo/silo.h
   src/silo/silo.inc > src/silo/silo_f.h
