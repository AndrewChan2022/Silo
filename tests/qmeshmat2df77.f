C
C using 2D Fortran arrays A(#rows,#cols) stored column major (e.g.
C row index varies fastest as you march through A's memory). Note
C that #rows is size in Y direction while #cols is size in X
C direction. So, A is dimensioned (nY,nX). In Fortran, the left-most
C dimension in an array declaration varies fastest when marching 
C through array elements in memory. However, the 'dims' array in
C Silo's DBPut calls is arranged such that dims[0] is the size in
C X, dims[1] the size in Y and dims[2], if applicable, the size in Z.
C So, although we have declarations for A(3,4), the dims array is
C passed in as dims[0] = 4, dims[1] = 3
