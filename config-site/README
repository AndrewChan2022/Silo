This directory contains examples of site configuration files.  To
quote from the autoconf manual:

    If the environment variable `CONFIG_SITE' is set,
    `configure' uses its value as the name of a shell script
    to read.  Otherwise, it reads the shell script
    `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
    `PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Thus, settings in
    machine-specific files override those in
    machine-independent ones in case of conflict.
