<h3>2. Bugs fixed in this release</h3>
<ul>

were fixed.<br>
  </li>
  <li>silock now works for data produced on HDF5 driver.</li>
  <li>silodiff corrrectly sets $lowlevel variable so that HDF5 file
differences cannot be missed.</li>
  <li>browser now displays mixvals for ucdvars.</li>
  <li>libsilo.a|so no longer has dependence on libreadline.</li>
  <li>Fortran interface now correctly compiles for Windows.</li>
  <li>A double-free memory error causing silex to crash was fixed.</li>
  <li>A missing pmpio.h include file dependency was added.</li>
  <li>Browser now supports version of Silo library it is linked with.</li>
  <li>A problem where once compression features were enabled, they
could never be disabled was corrected.</li>
  <li>Multi-part, multi-block objects written on Windows but read on
Linux and vice-versa now<br>
correctly handles the difference in slash character for filesystem
pathnames.</li>
  <li>A problem where silo.h and config.h were being included in source
distribution tarballs<br>
in spite of fact that these files are generated from their .in
equivalents was corrected.</li>
  <li>A bug in DBInqFile where it would return true for any PDB file,
even a PDB file NOT produced by<br>

  <li>DBCLOSE Fortran wrapper was corrected to set closed dbid to -1.</li>
  <li>Silo's magic file was corrected so that '!' character in PDB
