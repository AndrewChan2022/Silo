<h3>Announcing the release of version 4.7.2 of the Silo Library</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Obtain source code at <a
 href="https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/silo/silo-4.7.2/silo-4.7.2.tar.gz">https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/silo/silo-4.7.2/silo-4.7.2.tar.gz</a></li>
  <li>Obtain documentation at
https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/silo/media/pdf/LLNL_SM_421083.pdf</li>
</ul>
This release is to correct a couple critical problems with the 4.7.1
release. The 4.7.1 release has<br>
been removed from the web site and uninstalled from LLNL systems.<br>
<br>
Again apologies for the problems in the 4.7.1 release. This release has
been tested and valgrind'd<br>
against its own test suite as well as with VisIt 1.12 and VisIt 2.0.<br>
<br>
Silo 4.7.2 is link-time compatible with 4.7.1 except for codes using
DB_LONG_LONG. This is<br>
because the way DB_LONG_LONG was being handled in the Silo header file
had to change<br>
to correct a problem with it.<br>
<h3>Critical bugs fixed in this release</h3>
<ul>
  <li>DB_LONG_LONG is no longer mapped to DB_LONG on platforms where<br>
sizeof(long)==sizeof(long long).</li>
  <li>The problem where centering for Quadvars was always being treated
as node<br>
centered was corrected.</li>
  <li>A UMR in handling of arrays of strings in multi-block objects was
corrected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other bugs fixed in this release<br>
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Diffing data of different type in browser is now commutative.</li>
  <li>Default formats for printing long and long long data in base 8/16
were corrected.</li>
  <li>Missing diffing parameters for long long type were added.</li>
  <li>Some leaks and a memory error were corrected in a couple of tests.</li>
  <li>Overlap of src/dst in a strcpy in PDB was fixed.</li>
</ul>
